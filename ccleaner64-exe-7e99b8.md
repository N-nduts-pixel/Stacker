CCleaner64.exe is the executable file associated with CCleaner, a popular system optimization and privacy tool developed by Piriform, which is now part of Avast. The version 5.61.0.7392 of this software is designed to clean up unnecessary files, optimize system performance, and protect user privacy by removing browsing history and other potentially sensitive data. Generally considered safe when downloaded from the official website, CCleaner has faced scrutiny in the past due to security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns, particularly after a notable incident in 2017 involving malware distribution. Users should ensure they are using the latest version to mitigate risks and may occasionally encounter errors related to registry cleaning or file deletion, so it is advisable to back up important data before performing system optimizations. Overall, while CCleaner64.exe can be a useful tool for maintaining system performance, users should exercise caution and stay informed about updates and best practices for safe usage.
