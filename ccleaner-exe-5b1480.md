CCleaner.exe is the executable file for CCleaner, a popular system optimization and privacy tool developed by Piriform, designed to clean up unused files, optimize system performance, and enhance privacy by removing browsing history and other potentially sensitive data. While CCleaner has a strong reputation for improving computer performance, users should exercise caution as there have been instances of the software being bundled with potentially unwanted programs or experiencing vulnerabilities that could expose users to security risks. The version 5.61.0.7392, in particular, was noted for some errors related to its functionality, leading some users to question its reliability. Overall, while CCleaner is generally considered safe when downloaded from the official website, users must remain vigilant against counterfeit versions that may contain viruses or malware, ensuring that they keep the software up to date to mitigate potential risks.
